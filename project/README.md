I am making a website where that will allow users to do speed networking. The users will upload an image of them selves and their name, then they can do speed networking where they get data from a server showing them the profile of the person they should go talk to.






-make your own branch
-test branch with npm run dev in project folder
-commit changes to the branch
-merge branch to main, delete branch and then fetch prune in your editor
